## Status

This project is under (*very*) early development, with breaking changes happening often. I expect to add a lot of features as I shape ROBERT into more of a stable application soon. 

Here is some information on the state of this project:
  
  - Using a fixed SQLite3 database for development
  - Implemented functionality to:
    - Fetch data from the web
    - Organize it into a db
    - Load into memory
    - Povide it to the engie (Track & Trail if you read the source code)

Planned features (in order of priority):

 - Engine architecture and auto structure (the priority is to have at least basic auto support asap)
 - Engine map functionality
 - Output desing and results display
 - Working terminal UI
 - Small auto and indicator library
